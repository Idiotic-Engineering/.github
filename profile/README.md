# First and Foremost
We want to express our deep gratitude to RH3D, the E3NG ecosystem, and its amazing community.
Most of our projects, modifications, and addons are inspired by or built for the E3NG space. Projects intended for the E3NG ecosystem will always be clearly specified.

Weâ€™re proud to show our support and highly encourage everyone to consider supporting RH3D on Patreon or joining the RH3D Discord community.
